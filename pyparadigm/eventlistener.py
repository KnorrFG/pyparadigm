"""The Eventlistener wraps pygames event-loop.

The Core method is the listen() method.
It gathers the events that have piled up in pygame so far
and processes them acording to handler functions.
This allows for a main-loop free script design, which is more suited for
experimental paradigms.
In a typical experiment the script just waits for a userinput and does nothing,
or only a very few things in between. Approaching this need with a main
event-loop requires the implementation of some sort of statemachine, which again
requires quite some code.

The EventListener enables one to write scripts in a time-linear manner, and only
dab into local event-loops whenever neccessary throught the listen-function.

There are a few pre-implemented methods, which cover most of those use-cases in
the developement of experimental paradigms.

* wait_for_keypress() will return once a key was pressed n times.
* wait_for_keys_timed_out() will wait for one of multiple possible keys, 
    but return after the given timeout in any case
* and wait_for_seconds will simply wait the given time, but in the mean-time run
  what ever handlers were passed to the EventListener.

By default, there is one permanent handler, which will call exit(1) when 
Ctrl + c is pressed.

        registered listeners. There are two ways to register a listener:

        1. as a permanent listener, that is always executed for every event. These
            are registered by passing the handler-functions during construction
        
        2. as a temporary listener, that will only be executed during the current
            call to listen(). These are registered by passing the handler functions
            as arguments to listen()

        When a handler is called it can provoke three different reactions through
        its return value.

        1. It can return EventConsumerInfo.DONT_CARE in which case the EventListener
            will pass the event to the next handler in line, or go to the next event,
            if the last handler was called.

        2. It can return EventConsumerInfo.CONSUMED in which case the event will not
            be passed to following handlers, and the next event in line will be
            processed.

        3. It can return anything else (including None, which will be returned if no
            return value is specified) in this case the listen()-method will return
            the result of the handler.
